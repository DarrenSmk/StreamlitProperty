# Data Analysis of Hong Kong Property (1997-2022)

## Purpose

The purpose of this project is to understand the situation of Hong Kong property market from 1997 to 2022.

## Description
As we all know, Hong Kong's property market is the most expensive market in the world, and we believe that there is a huge bubble to be bursted. Therefore, we would like to investigate the reasons and try to forecast the market performance in the coming 10 years. The property market was analysed with different perspective such as the Hong Kong population structure, property transactions history, government policy, China's economy and US's economy. After all, some recomendations were addressed.
